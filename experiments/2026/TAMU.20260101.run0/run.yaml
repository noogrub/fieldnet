intent: "Sample / schema validation run (facility closed)"

description: >
  This run is a non-beam dry-run used to validate FieldNet
  fault-injection and logging schemas prior to live irradiation.
  Logging captures full node state, fault bundle, and provenance
  at every tick to support downstream plotting and replay tests.

notes:
  logging_policy: >
    Logging is configured for maximum verbosity (every tick, no rotation)
    to validate schema completeness. This policy is not representative
    of live beam runs, which may downsample or rotate logs.
